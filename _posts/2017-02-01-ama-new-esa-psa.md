On the 16th of January 2017, ESA [announced](http://sci.esa.int/solar-system/58694-esa-planetary-science-archive-gets-a-new-look/) the release of the new ESA's Planetary Science Archive (PSA) [user interface](https://archives.esac.esa.int/psa/), *"the online interface to data from the agency's space science missions that have been exploring planets, moons and other small bodies in the Solar System. With a new design and enhanced search functionalities, the platform now provides a direct and simple access to the scientific data, helping scientists to discover and explore the archive content."*

**OpenPlanetary is organising an exclusive “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) with Sebastien Besse and Isa Barbarisi, respectively Science and Technical Lead of the ESA's PSA, who kindly accepted to answer all your questions about the new user interface and its future development. It is also the opportunity to give them your feedback.**

The AMA online event is opened to all OpenPlanetary (OP) members, and will take place on the OP Slack **[#ama-new-esa-psa](https://openplanetary.slack.com/messages/ama-new-esa-psa)** channel between *5pm and 6pm CET on the 2nd of March 2017*. The discussion will have no particular structure, but will be facilitated by the OP team. If you are not an OP member, don't worry: you're very welcome to [register](https://openplanetary.typeform.com/to/QREyIA) (it takes one minute).

Play around with the new PSA interface, and hopefully see you soon!

*— The OpenPlanetary Team*
