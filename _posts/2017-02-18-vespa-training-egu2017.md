The solar and planetary sciences Virtual Observatory is in its growing phase. It is time to spread the tools to the community in order to collect user experience, as well as gain new users. Various tools have been developed in the frame of EU-FP7 and H2020 projects (Europlanet, HELIO, IMPEx...).

[EuroPlanet](http://www.europlanet-2020-ri.eu) [VESPA](http://europlanet-vespa.eu) organises periodic tutorials at major planetary conferences.

The upcomning EGU 2017 General Assembly will host one of such tutorials.

The tutorial session will be on Tuesday 25 April 2017, 17:30 - 20:00 , in room 2.16. It is now listed as Short Course number 18 (SC18) in the [session programme](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2017/sessionprogramme/stm).

We propose a hands-on workshop where the participants may select several tutorials. The aim of this workshop is three-fold: train the community, attract new users, and collect users feedback. Further details at: [http://www.europlanet-vespa.eu](http://www.europlanet-vespa.eu)
