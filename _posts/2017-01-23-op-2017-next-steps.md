**On behalf of the OpenPlanetary team, we would like to wish you all an happy new year!
May it be a year of fruitful collaborations, personal achievements and scientific discoveries —  What could you wish for OpenPlanetary in 2017?**

From the beginning OpenPlanetary (OP) has been, and will always be, an effort by and for the planetary science community. We, the OpenPlanetary team, are a small group of volunteers passionate about fostering Open Science practices and a collaborative spirit within the planetary science community. In 2017, we intend to keep experimenting to help and be useful to you: the community, but we always need your feedback, suggestions, and contributions.

*Where OpenPlanetary is heading to depends on you!*

## Our Blog

We have been really pleased with the success of our blog since [we launched it 4 months ago](http://openplanetary.co/blog/community/new-website-blog.html).
Thank to many [contributors](http://openplanetary.co/blog/authors/), we managed to publish a new post every week and get a fair amount of readers, with 1728 users in total and 47% returning visitors:

*We won't stop here.*

* We will be preparing a blog post/tutorial series on handling digital planetary data.
* We will redesign our website to make our blog more engaging, readable and searchable.
* We will make it easier for authors to push content to our blog on GitHub.
* We will try and provide some further support for collaborative research and data handling/processing/analysis, including practical documentation.

In this respect, any input is welcome, both from inside and outside OP.

## New ideas

New ideas of collaborative projects are sprouting within the OP community. Among those there are: *PlanetaryPy*, an initiative to create a consolidated planetary science Python package ([read post](http://openplanetary.co/blog/community/dps-conference.html)), and *OpenPlanetaryMap* (OPM), an initiative to build an Open Planetary Mapping platform for researchers, educators, and the general public ([read post](http://openplanetary.co/blog/community/whereonmars-opm.html))

A *Planetary Mapping and Virtual Observatory* workshop is coming up ([see website](https://epn-vespa.github.io/mapping2017/)). Remote participation through Slack is planned already. So is an hackathon component. More on this in a post very soon.

A first online *Ask Me Anything* (AMA) event to discuss the new ESA's Planetary Science Archive (PSA) web interface ([here](https://archives.esac.esa.int/psa)) will be announced very soon too.

**Stay tuned and thanks in advance for your feedback!**

*— The OpenPlanetary Team*
